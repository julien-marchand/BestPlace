#To mount a CD and not boot from it
# normally, we would say 'tap:aio:/hd2/Fedora-9-x86_64-DVD.iso,hdc:cdrom,r' to load a cd rom into IDE-2 master



# : will display something like /dev/loop1: [0811]:24577 (/hd2/winxpsp2.iso)
#and now you can use 'phy:/dev/loop0,hdc:cdrom,r' as cd, remember to set boot="dc" on the next line if you want to boot from hdc (Our CD)
